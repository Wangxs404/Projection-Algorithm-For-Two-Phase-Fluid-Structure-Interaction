# Projection-Algorithm-For-Two-Phase-Fluid-Structure-Interaction
We present a Pressure-Oscillation-Free projection algorithm for large-density-ratio multiphase fluid-structure interaction simulations, implemented on a non-staggered Cartesian grid. The incompressible Navier-Stokes is decoupled with an improved incremental pressure correction algorithm.
